Departure Board Sample App
==========================

### How To Run

From your command line, run:
```sh
nodejs index.js
```

This will start a simple NodeJS based web server on port 3000.

Going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser will bring up the page.

### Notes
- Tried to keep things as simple as possible
- As long as you have NodeJS installed, you should be able to run it
- There are no external dependencies
- [Tacit](http://yegor256.github.io/tacit/) a class-less CSS framework was used to enhance readability
